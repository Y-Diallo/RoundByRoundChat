sky islands map - permanently day

slowly spawn mobs for the round with a slight frontload
wall gun
unlock section with points (points based off of the mob kills)
//boss give even points to all, mob to who killed it


15 rounds of slowly harder mobs with a 16th round with bosses from every 3rd round

leave override options for me
ex.
"override next round" (kill old zombie) // incase of mob stuck
"override mob stuck" (move old zombie) // incase of mob stuck

op/unop to make sure chat stays clear

flow goes as follows
//also check bossmob number and make round over run once
set roundmobs left and boss mobs to appropriate number for next round
round start

//make mobs invulerable to despawning and override mob spawning if needed
spawn mobs slowly 
when all mobs dead
next round

use loot tables to buy bullets or
buy bullets with buttons

main program just needs to do 4 things
commands
spawning mobs/setting amount of mobs
round control/announcement

when spawning boss mobs add one to pastCurrentBossMobs and current

//for calculating score
killDifferential - amount of mobs dead in one tick
bossDifferential - amount of bosses dead in one tick
pastCurrentBossMobs - amount of mobs in previous tick
pastRoundKills - amount of bosses in previous tick
Factor - Factor to multiply the num of kills by
Score - score from killing mobs (individual to player)

//for calculating state of round
currentRoundMobsLeft - current number of mobs left in round
roundEnd - signals 1 for outside of round 0 for in round
TotalRoundMobs - total number of mobs for that round (set by node)
currentTotalMobs - total mobs alive

//both
roundKill - number of kills of mobs in round (individual to player)
currentMobs - current number of mobs alive
currentBossMobs - current number of boss mobs alive

//special
mobStuck - trigger for tping mobs to players in case of lost or stuck mobs
