sky islands map - permanently day

slowly spawn mobs for the round with a slight frontload
wall gun
unlock section with points (points based off of the mob kills)
//boss give even points to all, mob to who killed it


15 rounds of slowly harder mobs with a 16th round with bosses from every 3rd round

leave override options for me
ex.
"override next round" (kill old zombie) // incase of mob stuck
"override mob stuck" (move old zombie) // incase of mob stuck

op/unop to make sure chat stays clear

flow goes as follows
//also check bossmob number and make round over run once
set roundmobs left and boss mobs to appropriate number for next round
round start

//make mobs invulerable to despawning and override mob spawning if needed
spawn mobs slowly 
when all mobs dead
next round

use loot tables to buy bullets or
buy bullets with buttons

main program just needs to do 4 things
commands
spawning mobs/setting amount of mobs
round control/announcement

when spawning boss mobs add one to pastCurrentBossMobs and current
